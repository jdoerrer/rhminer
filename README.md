## Mining locally/Solo
To mine locally/solo you'll need the official PascalCoin wallet https://github.com/PascalCoin/PascalCoin/releases <br>
In order to mine locally with rhminer, **You need to set a miner name smaller than 26 characters and mine into a private key with encryption type secp256k1**<br>
The best way to assure you're mining in a secp256k1 private key is to create one and select it in the option **"Always mine with this key"**.<br>
**Do not use the "Use random existing key" option** because if one of your key is not a secp256k1 key, the miner will exit when. Plus when there is to much keys in the wallet it gives out errors, sometimes, when submiting nonces<br>
To ensure your miner name is correct, go to Project menu, then Options and set a miner name smaller than 26 characters<br>
To get the number of logical cores, on you system, simply run rhminer with the -completelist option. The last line is the cpu description with the amount of logical core. Ex :<br>
```
C:\rhminer>rhminer -completelist

CPU : Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz with 4 logical cores
```
This tells you what is the ideal maximum number of threads for cpu mining (-cputhreads) <br>

```
Solo mining examples:  rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s http://127.0.0.1:4009 -cpu -cputhreads 1 -extrapayload HelloWorld

```
Note2: It is not recommended to mine using a laptop.

## Tested on

**NOTE: I do not recommend to overclock your cpu. If you do it, it's at your own risk.**


note: raw is for raw performance on all hyper-threads. This does not represent real life performance.

## ScreenSaver
To download the screensaver go to release section here https://github.com/polyminer1/rhminer/releases and download **PascalCoinScreenSaver.zip** <br>
To install PascalCoin ScreenSaver simply right-click on file PascalCoinScreenSaver.scr and click "install" from the menu. <br>
Then you can configure it. <br>
For Laptop users it is *STROGLY* recommented to set only 1 thread in the scrensaver's config. <br>
 <br>
To set a mining password open regedit.exe and append your password command line, followed by a space, to the string located here : **Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\PascalCoin\ScreenSaver\extra** <br>
EX: -pw MyEmail@email.com <br>
Dont forget to put a space at the end. <br>

## Troubleshoot
On Windows 7/8/10, if you get the missing OpenCL.dll error you need to download it into rhminer's folder. (hint: You can safely get one with the Intel SDK on Intel's opencl website)

                        ex: -processorsaffinity 0,3 will make the miner run only on logical core #0 and #3.
                        WARNING: Changing this value will affect GPU mining.
  -h                    Display Help
  -help                 Display Help
  -?                    Display Help

Optimizations options:
  -memoryboost          This option will enable some memory optimizations that could make the miner slower on some cpu.
                        Test it with -testperformance before using it.
                        1 to enable boost. 0 to disable boost.
                        Enabled, by default, on cpu with hyperthreading.
  -sseboost             This option will enable some sse4 optimizations.
                        It could make the miner slower on some cpu.
                        Test it with -testperformance before using it.
                        1 to enable SSe4.1 optimizations. 0 to disable.
                        Disabled by default. 
  -cputhrottling        Slow down mining by internally throttling the cpu. 
                        This is usefull to prevent virtual computer provider throttling vCpu when mining softwares are detected.
                        Min-Max are 0 and 99.

Gpu options:
  -cpu                  Enable the use of CPU to mine.
                        ex '-cpu -cputhreads 4' will enable mining on cpu while gpu mining.
  -cputhreads           Number of CPU miner threads when mining with CPU. ex: -cpu -cputhreads 4.
                        NOTE: adding + before thread count will disable the maximum thread count safety of one thread per core/hyperthread.
                        Use this option at your own risk.

Network options:
  -s                    Stratum/wallet server address:port.
                        NOTE: You can also use http://address to connect to local wallet.

  -fop                  Failover password for stratum or local wallet
  -r                    Retries connection count for stratum or local wallet
  -dar                  Disable auto-reconnect on connection lost.
                        Note : The miner will exit uppon loosing connection. 

Debug options:
  -testperformance      Run performance test for an amount of seconds
  -testperformancethreads Amount of threads to use for performance test

```

## Examples
```
With config file:
 First use : Edit config.txt and set "s", "su" and desired "cputhreads" or "gputhreads"
 
 Mining with default config.txt : rhminer.exe
 Mining with specific config file : rhminer.exe -configfile {config file pathname}

 With command line:
 Mining solo on cpu          : rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s http://127.0.0.1:4009 -cpu -cputhreads 4 -extrapayload HelloWorld
 Mining solo on cpu          : rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s http://127.0.0.1:4009 -cpu -cputhreads 4 -extrapayload HelloWorld
 Mining on a pool            : rhminer.exe -v 2 -r 20 -s stratum+tcp://somepool.com:1379 -su MyUsername -extrapayload Rig1
```

## Api access
Default port is 7111.  <br>
Api supports EthMan api format and structure with some limitations. <br>
- At the exception of 'miner_getstat1', the rest of the api needs a pw that match what was passed to rhminer (see -apipw with rhminer and 'Password' field in EthMan)
- For security reasons, method "miner_file" ONLY accept config.txt and config.xml.
  - The config file must be under 8K
  - The config file must be an rhminer compatible config file containing xml data
  - With parameter 'forcerestart' the miner will restart uppon reception of the config file, no mather what was the command line given to rhminer orignialy.
- miner_getstat2 return same as miner_getstat1
- Fan and temperature data are all zero
<br>
To change miner's config remotly, using EthMan, you send a config.txt first then send a restart command to the miner. <br>
    
Just sending empty string will return mining status in json format like that:
```
{
	"infos": [
        {
			"name": "CPU",
			"threads": 2,
			"speed": 266,
			"accepted": 3,
			"rejected": 0,
			"temp": 0,
			"fan": 0
		}
	],
	"speed": 380,
	"accepted": 4,
	"rejected": 0,
	"failed": 0,
	"uptime": 91,
	"extrapayload": "",
	"stratum.server": "localhost:4109",
	"stratum.user": "",
	"diff": 0.00000049
}
```

## Developer Donation
Default donation is 1%. <br>
Donation is hardcoded in the binaries downloadable on gitgub. That is to recoup the 6 month it toke to R&D, develop, stabilize and optimize this miner and for the upcoming bug fixes and many upcoming optimizations. <br>
To disable donation download and compile locally, then use the -devfee option with chosen donation percentage. 0 will disable the donation. <br>
